# OpenAPI \(AKA Swagger\)

As of Relax v2.3 and above, the [OpenAPI v2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) is the default format for documentation in Relax. The previous RelaxDSL has been deprecated and is schedule to sunset at Relax v4.0.

The OpenAPI specification offers a convenient and portable way to describe your API, its requirements, parameters, and data conventions. You may also choose to use this to describe your API in the form of [HTTP OPTIONS responses](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) to fulfill [CORS requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) or to allow rich [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) documentation for your consumers.

By convention, Relax looks for supported formats in the following order \(note that the top-level file shares the name of the parent directory\):

1. `myResourceDirectory/myapi/myapi.json`  - JSON OpenAPI schema
2. `myResourceDirectory/myapi/myapi.yaml` - YAML OpenAPI schema
3. `myResourceDirectory/myapi/Relax.cfc` - Relax programmatic DSL \(deprecated\)

Example \( a segment of the [Forgebox API](https://www.forgebox.io/) \):

    },
    "x-extensionDetection": true,
    "x-throwOnInvalidExtension": false
}
```

Note the use of the `x-` attributes, which allow for extensions of the Swagger specification, In addition, more complex API's can use the `$ref` syntax to denote locations and keys of relative JSON files:

```text
"paths": {
        "/echo": {"$ref": "paths.json#echo"}
},
```

This notates that the definition for the path `/echo` is found in `paths.json` under the `echo` key. Using the `$ref` notation allows you to store schema examples and other code samples separate from the main JSON or YAML description of your site.

## YAML Support

Per the Swagger formats description:

> The files describing the RESTful API in accordance with the Swagger specification are represented as JSON objects and conform to the JSON standards. YAML, being a superset of JSON, can be used as well to represent a Swagger specification file.

Relax includes support for YAML-format API descriptions, as well.

For full descriptions and examples of the schema specification [read the official OpenAPI v2 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).
