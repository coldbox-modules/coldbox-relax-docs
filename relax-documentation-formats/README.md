# Relax Documentation Formats

As of Relax v2.3 and above, the [OpenAPI v2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) is the default format for documentation in Relax. The previous RelaxDSL has been deprecated and is schedule to sunset at Relax v4.0. It is, however, still available for use through that time, to support previous documentation.

## ColdBox Relax Available Formats:

* [**OpenAPI/Swagger**](openapi-aka-swagger.md)
* [**Relax Programmatic DSL \(Deprecated\)**](index/)
