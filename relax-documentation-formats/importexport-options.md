# Import and Export Formats

Relax allows you to import an OpenAPI/Swagger JSON specification in to your defined `apiResources` directory, export normalized schema \(JSON\) for other services and also four export formats:

* HTML
* PDF
* WikiText
* TRAC Format

Markdown export is planned for an upcoming minor release.
