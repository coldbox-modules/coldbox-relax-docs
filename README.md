> RELAX = RESTFul Tools For Lazy Experts!

What is Relax? ColdBox Relax is a set of RESTFul tools for lazy experts. We pride ourselves in helping you \(the developer\) work smarter, saving yourself time to write great applications!

Relax is a tool to help you document and describe your API services to both end-users, as well as providing an interface for testing endpoint responses.

Providing you with the necessary tools to "automagically" model, document and test your RESTFul services, think of ColdBox Relax as a key tool in your RESTFul web services toolkit.
